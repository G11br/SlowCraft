## Overview

SlowCraft is a desktop application designed to enhance your video editing experience by generating stunning slow-motion effects. It leverages the power of RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation) to interpolate frames and create smooth slow-motion videos. Built using Python and Tkinter, this open-source tool provides an intuitive interface for users to easily process their videos.

## Features

- **Frame Interpolation**: Utilizes RIFE technology to create additional frames for smoother slow-motion playback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter, the application is easy to navigate, making it accessible for users of all skill levels.
- **Video Processing**: Supports various video formats and resolutions, allowing for versatile video enhancement.
- **Open Source**: The code is available for anyone to view, modify, and contribute to.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring a wide reach.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **FFmpeg**: A powerful multimedia framework to handle video processing.
- **RIFE**: The real-time frame interpolation engine that powers the slow-motion effect.
- **ncnn**: A high-performance neural network inference framework.
- **Vulkan**: A modern graphics API that enhances performance.
